\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Justification}

We have decided to work with the boardgame Settlers of Catan. The idea is to
visualize the effects of starting choices on the outcome of the game. It is a
game about managing odds and hedging your bets, so frequent players will be
interested in knowing what types of starting locations that gives a high
chance of winning. 

There have not been much work done on the topic but we found one analysis by a 
Peter Keep
\footnote{https://developingcatan.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/settlers-of-catan-analysis.pdf}.
The quality of the analysis is debatable and he did not do a great job
visualizing it. In any case we are pioneering the subject and the world will
be stunned by our genius. All hail the conquerors of the Settler statistics.

\subsection{About the game}

Settlers of Catan is a game where you and a number of other players settle
an island. During the course of the game you acquire resources, build
improvements and acquire points. The first to 10 points wins the game. 

For our project it is important to know that a settlement is located next
to 3 resource tiles with a number tile on top. Whenever the dice outcome is
the same as a number of a tile all players next to it receive a resource
token. Settlements can also be located next to the sea where there are habors
that can be used to trade resources.
